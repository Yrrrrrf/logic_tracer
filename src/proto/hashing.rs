//! Hashing functions.
//! 
//! This module contains a hashing function for the project.
//! 
//! The hash is a function that maps a string of any length to a fixed-length string.
//! This is a one-way function, i.e. it is not possible to find the original string from the hash.
//! 
//! So the hash is used to verify the integrity of the data.
//! It means that if the hash of the data is the same, then the data has not been modified.
//! If the hash is different, then the data has been modified.
//! 
//! The hash is also used to **verify the authenticity of the data**.
//!
